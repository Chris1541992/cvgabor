= Requirements =
To build fully-functionaly libraries and demos, you need have:
  * GTK+ 2.x or higher.
  * libpng, zlib, libjpeg and libtiff with development files.
  * libavcodec from ffmpeg 0.4.9-pre1 or later + headers.
Earlier version do not work with OpenCV because of different API. *libavcodec* is *LGPL* software, so to use it with *non-GPL* software (such as OpenCV) you need to build and use a shared library _libavcodec.so.*_

Get *ffmpeg* from http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net

Build *ffmpeg* on your system
{{{
./configure --enable-shared
make
make install
}}}
You will get:

_/usr/local/lib/libavcodec.so.*_

_/usr/local/lib/libavformat.so.*_

_/usr/local/include/ffmpeg/*.h_

in your _/usr/_ directory.
